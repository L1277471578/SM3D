# SM3D: Mitigating Spectral Bias and Semantic Dilution in Point Cloud State Space Models

[[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11099) 

We will release the code and weights soon!

## To do
- ⏳ release the model and evaluation code...
- ⏳ Release [pretraining](https://github.com/L1277471578/Hybrid-Emba3D/releases/download/v1.0/pretrain_pointmae.pth) and finetune weights

## Experimental Results on ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN
This table compares the performance of different 3D point cloud architectures on ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN datasets. Our SM3D achieves state-of-the-art results with:
- 🏆96.0% accuracy on ModelNet40 (with voting)
- 93.27% on hardest PB_T50_RS variant
